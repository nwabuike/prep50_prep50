                    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Engage</h2>
                    <span class="btm-bar"></span>
                    <p>According to Harvard psychologist, every child needs two basic things to be able to learn anything. Those two things are <b>interest</b> and <b>interaction</b>. If you look closely to those two “I’s, you will agree with me that they are talking about engagement. If you engage any child with any activity, he/she is bound by the interest you aroused and the interaction you created to learn such activity/task well. This is exactly what is lacking in almost all of our schools. There is little to no engagement and if you found a Nanny/tutor for your kids. The whole idea is that you want someone to engage your kids in the different domains of learning both cognitive, the psychomotor and the affective domain. We usually refer to this idea as finding someone who can handle our kids “one on one” or “1 to 1”. The idea of 1 to 1 is simply a search for engagement..</p>
                    <p>The question now is having hired the tutor is your child being engaged or do they go to pee every second or get distracted with cartoons? Are they responding to the activities or is the tutor complaining that they are stubborn and heady. Some will complain that your child cannot sit down one place; well the simple problem is that he/she is not engaged; change the channel to cartoon and that child will take a seat quietly and consume the content with rapt attention. He is engaged! Start playing football or throwing balloons up and down with him/her, he will be focused but when you open a book, every interest is gone and all interactions are seized. It is probably because you are just doing the same thing they are doing in schools that has not worked. I will give you a concrete example, a teacher wants to teach students about tenses and he designed these printed text and labelled cups and came to class with them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 ntAboutThumb">
                    <img src="images/prep50_engage1.jpg" alt="about-1" />
                    <p>The students are expected to read the printed text and put it into the appropriate cup. The cups are labelled present tense, past tense, future tense etc. after a brief introduction of the topic, the activities will start and every student will take from the pack, read it aloud and decide tense in the sentence and then put the paper bearing the text into the appropriate cup. A successful attempt merits you a point. Please tell me,</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;;">
                        <li> a) Is any of those child going sleep?</li>
                        <li>b) Is any of those child going to be distracted?</li>
                        <li>c) Is any of those child going to lose interest?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the teacher continued with the ususal method as they do in schools to write on the board and explain with some dry example,</p>
                    <h5>What do you think will happen?</h5>
                    <h5>How many students will sleep off?</h5>
                    <h5>How many will understand what exactly he is saying? </h5>
                    <p>This is the point. Our education is dying not just because the smart minds are not in the class teaching but because the teachers available, lack the creativity and imagination to engage our children to the point where they can arouse their interest to learn new stuffs; that singular ability to craft new ideas with which to learn the same stuff over and over again is what helps kids to learn as they grow. You have to repeat the task over and over again but you need creativity to make those repetitions engaging. This is exactly what our prep50 engage is designed to achieve.</p>
                    <p>To help parents, nannies and private tutors generate enough creative and imaginative ideas that will engage students to continue to learn and demonstrate their knowledge in full glare of everybody. We have not only provided the creative learning ideas but also we have carefully sculptured learning aids that will help you do that engagement and strengthen both the cognitive and psychomotor domain of the individual child in the process.</p>

                    <p>The skills to be learnt covers the entire curriculum in English and Mathematics from crèche to Basic three and beyond. We designed them as skills that your child can learn by demonstration. The literacy skill has close to 500 skills within it while the numeracy skill has above 600 skills your child needs to develop before age 10.</p>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Studies have shown that 58% children who fail to grasp these basic skills are already set up for failure in their future academic endeavor because of the gap in their foundational knowledge.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Concrete foundation:</b> Prep50 engage provides your child with the foundational knowledge needed to develop their literacy and numeracy skills for life.</li>
                        <li><b>Brighter Future:</b> Mastering the 1,100 skills on prep50 engage will set them up for a brighter future.</li>
                        <li><b>Demonstrable Learning:</b> The beauty of these engagement tools for kids is that all knowledge gained must be demonstrated. If a child knows it he/she must show it, Simple.</li>
                        <li><b>Instant feedback:</b> Instantly know where your child needs help irrespective of all the complaints from his/her teacher/tutors.</li>
                        <li><b>Transferable skills:</b> These skills are transferable skills. If a tutor can skip-count by five backward from 100, your child can! </li>
                        <li><b>Family Play:</b> Prep50 engage can serve as a uniting point for all family members as both parents and children can play the spelling game and teach each other effectively.</li>
                        <li><b>Foundation for Critical Thinking:</b> The foundation for logic and critical thinking starts here. When students engage in topics that deals with comparisons, they are already learning patterns, sorting out differences and mapping out similarities. These are the foundations of logic and critical thinking. Most adults that cannot think critically today were not able to understand these basics of sorting, classifying, ordering etc. Every critical thought requires sorting of ideas and classifying them in terms of facts and values or otherwise. We have too many people who cannot think critically today and co-incidentally almost all of them do not know mathematics and it is easy to see that they missed these foundational knowledge hence their hatred for Maths and inability to reason properly. Don’t let your child join this group when they have the capacity to excel using the opportunity we have provided to you.</li>

                    <p>If you can hire a seasoned teacher to condense the whole curriculum in literacy and Numeracy from creche to primary and above you would have paid such teacher for 21 terms worth of work (63 months). That is more than five year of salary. And even if you pay &#8358;30,000 per month, it will be 1.8 million. We have condensed what your child will learn in 6years into measurable skills that can be demonstrated and we are not going to charge you like teachers in school or tutors that visit your home who you pay monthly. Even though our learning ideas and creative aids are best alternatives to what they contribute. For every 1:1 learning to be effective, they must have the creative ideas and interactivity tools to enable them drive engagement as earlier described.
                        We are not even going to charge you for a month salary that you pay your tutors or even some teachers that are supposed to have done all these stuff. Even though we are almost doing their job, yet they will still get paid more than us.
                        We will only be charging a onetime fee of

                    <p>This amount is nothing compared to what you will pay for private lessons in the maths, should your child miss these foundational learning. It is nothing compared to the private tutors you will hire in the future to help him. When you help him by using the prep50 engage you will save all these cost in future.</p>
                    <p>This amount is nothing compared to the DSTV subscription you do monthly every year to ensure that the cartoon network channel is always up for your child to have fun. But this learning engagement is far more important than cartoons. It is the bedrock of every future learning your child will undertake. It is the difference between your child loving to learn because everything is easy or your child finding it difficult to concentrate and learn because he has not gained the 1001 necessary skills needed to create a solid academic foundation.</p>
                    <p>You may decide to ignore this and that is at your own peril. Seize this opportunity today and set the coast clear for your son/daughter and provide him/her the much needed engagement so they can learn anything possible.</p>
                    <h5>MODE OF PAYMENT: </h5>
                    <p><b>Payment is on DELIVERY via TRANSFER/CASH</b></p>

                    <p>Children with poor literacy and numeracy skills in their early years have 85% chance of falling behind in future classes. Every day and with each passing night, your child is expected to add to this skill chest and the earlier you start to measure how filled up their skill chest is the better for you. At 15, it might be too late to start. It might be too complex to figure out how to help or what exactly is his problem.</p>
                    <p>Get the demonstrable game board and engage your child intensely and measure accurately their academic skills (linguistic and mathematical).</p>
