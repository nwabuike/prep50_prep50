                    <span class="btm-bar"></span>
                    <p>
                        Recently, while reading a brilliant book on early child development, I came across this fascinating line on a discovery made by some Harvard child psychologists. The noted that “Every child in their early years needs two basic forces/drives to be able to learn anything; Interest and Interaction”. Without which, they will turn out as hyper-active, stubborn, always distracted…you can fill in the rest. When I shared this new insight with a few friends, most of them commented that they had observed similar trends among their children. According to them, children who were effectively engaged in their early years with task after another and series of activities tend to be very smart and alert in school in their future studies and all round growth and development. Whereas; those who either lack interest in or someone to play and learn with, tend to be thick-headed or stubborn and not brilliant in school.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, why does constantly engaging our kids seem to make them far smarter and more brilliant children?</p>
                    <p>To understand why, you have to understand the difference between child rearing and child upbringing. </p>
                    <p>Anyone can rear children, you give birth, you provide food for the baby and after 3 months, you dump the baby in a nearby crèche where he/she is also fed and sent back home in the evening. But these basic survival needs are a tiny fraction of what human growth and development really is. Nurturing kids to develop their full potentials and capabilities as human requires massive effort in his or her upbringing.</p>
                    <p>Child upbringing is the way a child is raised or the range of lessons, instruction and teachings that was imparted on the child by his parents or guardian as they grow. These lessons and teachings are basically points of engagements for the child.</p>
                    <p>What this explanation is saying is that when you attempt child upbringing, you irreversibly start raising your child in a fundamentally different way which is characterized by constant engagement for the child.</p>
                    <p>The other day for example, I experienced one of these home tutors teaching the kids at home. It was a tough subject…tenses in English Language. Throughout the duration of the lesson, the tutor struggled to capture the attention of the child talk more of getting the child to learn the information he was pouring on him for the last 2hrs. I don’t believe the tutor is a lazy guy or a dumb fellow but the simple truth was that he couldn’t capture the two basic instincts needed in the child to drive learning which are interest and interaction. He could continue for another 2hours on the same topic using the same strategy of reeling out information upon another and I can guarantee you that he will achieve absolutely nothing. However, if he had gotten three different cups and labelled them ‘Present tense’, ‘Past Tense’, ‘Future tense’; then instead of writing examples on the whiteboard, he can make each students to write different examples on a piece of paper. They will read it loud and determine which cup the sentence that was read belongs to. If the child places the paper in the correct cup, that is if he was able to identify which tense was used in the sentence, he will score a point. Say, “Obi will come tomorrow” should be inserted into the future tense cup.</p>

                    <h3>Demonstrable learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        This type of learning is called <b>“Demonstrable learning”</b> or learning by demonstration and engagement. It requires two things.. Interest aroused by the activities and Interaction generated by the teacher; all these sums up as engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>But here is the problem, neither is easy to achieve</p>
                    <p>Driving engagement for children and matching their energy is very tiring and so stressful. Secondly, gaining their attention can only last for a very short while and way too short to get them to learn anything. So we are in a situation where we want to raise smart kids but the process is very tiring and stressful and we can only guarantee their attention only for a very short time.</p>
                    <p>This is exactly why our whole schooling system needs a radical change. It emphasizes attendance but our presence in class is far less significant in making us learn anything in class that the critical engagement we are talking about. Our education is dying, not just because the smart minds are no longer in the class teaching but because the teachers available lack the creativity and imagination to engage our children to the point where they can arouse their interest to learn new stuffs. The singular ability to craft new ideas with which to learn something over and over again is what helps kids learn as they grow. You have to repeat the tasks frequently but you also need creativity to make those repetitions engaging. This is exactly what our prep50 engage is designed to achieve.</p>
                    <p><b>So how do you shift from child rearing to child upbringing? </b></p>
                    <p>There is a model we use @ Prep50 to engineer interest and interaction and make any child learn anything, grow smarter and more intelligent.</p>
                    <p>To help parents, nannies and private tutors generate enough creative and imaginative ideas that will engage students to continue to learn and demonstrate their knowledge in full glare of everybody. We have not only provided the creative learning ideas but also we have carefully sculptured learning aids that will help you do that engagement and strengthen both the cognitive and psychomotor domain of the individual child in the process.</p>

                    <p>This amount is nothing compared to what you will normally pay for private lessons in Maths, that is, should your child miss these foundational learning. It is nothing compared to the private tutors you will hire in the future to help coach him academically. When you help him now using the model we have discussed, you will save all these cost in future.</p>
                    <p>This amount is also nothing compared to the DSTV subscription you do on monthly basis every year to ensure that the cartoon network channel is always up for your child to have fun. But this foundational learning engagement is far more important than cartoons. It is the bedrock of every future learning your child will undertake. It is the difference between your child loving to learn because everything is easy or your child finding it difficult to concentrate and learn because he has not gained the 1001 skills needed to create a solid academic foundation.</p>
                    <h5>The cost is &#8358;27, 000</h5>
                    <p>You may decide to ignore this and that is at your own peril. Seize this opportunity today and set the coast clear for your son/daughter and provide him/her with the much needed engagement so they can learn anything possible.</p>
                    <h4>MODE OF PAYMENT: </h4>
                    <p>Payment is either via transfer or cash on DELIVERY.</p>
                    <p>Children with poor literacy and numeracy skills in their early years have 85% chance of falling behind in future classes. Every day and with each passing night, your child is expected to add to this skill chest and the earlier you start to measure how filled up their skill chest is the better for you. At 15, it might be too late to start. It might be too complex to figure out how to help or what exactly is his problem.</p>
                    <p>Get the demonstrable game board and engage your child intensely and measure accurately their academic skills (linguistic and mathematical).</p>
